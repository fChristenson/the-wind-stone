## Secrets

- It appears to be the perfect image of a quaint fantasy village, known for having the lowest crime rate in the region. It has even won "Village of the Year" multiple years in a row. However, the local "Village Watch" seems suspicious, and there are a surprising number of "accidents" that seem to happen in the village, usually involving people or creatures that were seen as a threat to the quaint charm of the community.
- What at first appears to be a village of unusually slim dwarves that wear long, dragging capes turns out to be a village of humans all walking on their knees.
- The village is the creation of a wish of dying mother giving birth alone by a genie "I wish my child will be safe and loved." The wish summoned powerful spirits to build and maintain a village to raise the now orphaned child. The village is slightly quirky, even more antiquated than a normal isolated village, but friendly. The village will turn overly protective when anyone seems overly interested in the child.


## Quests

- A ship has gotten itself stuck in the ice and is requesting help in freeing itself. The only issue is that the ship matches the description of a raiding vessel recently seen terrorizing the area. - Campaign quest
- While travelling through a forest the players are accosted by druids (or elves?) who accuse them of trampling through a sacred grove and destroying it. As restitution they must plant the seed for a new holy tree in a difficult to reach location. - Adventure quest
- A local wizard passed away over 20 years ago, leaving his tower locked and warded. The only one with any clue as to how to get in, his apprentice, isn't talking. When others are asked about what they know, they quickly divert the conversation. Those that slink in the shadows may whisper about it, and it sounds like the tower holds things much darker than just books and phials. - City quest
- A famous explorer has been going around telling everyone about the treasure he’s found in some uncovered ruins, flaunting gold and riches! Anyone who pays attention can see that all of the coins were minted recently, but still it’s unknown how he came into this wealth. - Campaign quest
- A noble family in a bunch of debt marries off their daughter, the dowry serving as a last resort to pay debts. Not long before marriage, the daughter's face is disfigured on a horrible accident, and the groom to be calls the wedding off. - Royal family quest
