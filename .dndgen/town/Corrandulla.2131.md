- The local well’s water makes the town’s residents eternally youthful, and they will protect that secret at all costs.
- A god once died here, and its blood is pooled beneath the town. It grants them peace, good crops, and safety... but those with greedy intentions would slay every inhabitant there to possess such a treasure.
- A medieval hamlet, that seems a bit too advanced to be medieval. The villagers are crazy efficient at everything they do, and each one of them seems is really intelligent. Upon closer inspection, or being a close friend of everyone in the hamlet, they will reveal that they are a group of time travelers who ended up in the wrong time, with no way back home. As such, they decided to replicate a medieval village from what they've learned, and they're working on a time machine in an underground lab beneath the village.
- A creature that is revered or protected in the realm is secretly poached and consumed for its meat.
