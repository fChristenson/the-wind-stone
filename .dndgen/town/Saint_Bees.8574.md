## Secrets

- The entire population is a series of illusions and disguise made by one mad fey who uses them to pretend the village is populated. An elderly drunk rambles this fact to passersbys.
- There’s a large tree in the center of the village. Climbing or otherwise disturbing the tree is cause for execution. The large tree is actually a dormant treant. The village is very careful not to disturb his rest because he has saved the village from marauders in the past, and they rely on his favor to protect them.
- Last year, a few of the town's eldest houses conspired and murdered every last person of their rival families.
- The village is actually hiding its existence from the local baron, and hasn’t ever paid taxes as a result. This leaves them vulnerable to predation and banditry, but the villagers consider this worth the risk.


## Quests

- The party runs into a family member of one of the PCs who tells them that a family reunion is being planned. - Adventure quest
- The Princes Royal have harbored a grudge ever since they were toddlers and are always fighting. Stemming from a time when the elder brother struck the younger over the head with a wooden soldier he was playing with, they disagree on everything. The King is aging, and many wonder if the Princes will also fight over the succession... - Royal family quest
- A man was found on the street, seemingly died from a fall, but there are strange runic markings all over the victim’s body. - Murder quest
- A local merchant approaches the PCs to help him out. He swears that someone has replaced his magical goods with "almost equivalent" versions - a bag of "sort-of" holding, a belt of somewhat useful items, potions of temporary healing, etc. The city merchant's guild is threatening to put him out of business for swindling customers, but he swears he's being set up. - Adventure quest
