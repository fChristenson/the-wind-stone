## Secrets

- The village has a secret recipe for peach pie. It's really good pie.
- The village is actually hiding its existence from the local baron, and hasn’t ever paid taxes as a result. This leaves them vulnerable to predation and banditry, but the villagers consider this worth the risk.
- They secretly support a group of outlaws or pirates.

## Quests

- Mages throughout the realm dream of someone calling for help from a distant land. - Campaign quest
- Some people awake with a symbol on their foreheads. Complaints are made, but as the marks are not found to give off any malignant magic, it's brushed off as a prank. But then the bodies appear in the city square, mangled and broken, the symbols now carved in. - City quest
- The party receives a warm letter from a wizard they've never met thanking them for narrowly averting a disaster, and for being such good longtime friends. Almost immediately they receive a second letter, this one written in a much shakier and blunter hand imploring the PCs to help fixing the paradox the wizard has accidentally set in motion by sending his first letter too soon and changing history. Twist: The party must at one point fight their past selves Twerst: The wizard is one of the PCs from the future - Adventure quest
